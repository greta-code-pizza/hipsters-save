      p2: "Hats are for making public statements, not commemorating contributions to a project or jobs held.
          Please request one only if you'll be acting offically here, like if you're a core project developer or company employee authorized to post on behalf of your organization.
          Hats are usually reserved for notable projects and organizations."
      p3: 'To request a hat for your account, provide a short description of the hat
          (e.g., "OpenBSD Developer"), a public link that will be shown when hovering
          over the hat that users can see, such as your e-mail address at that project
          or company, or a link to a company website showing your employment, and

            If you can't or don't want to do that, you can delete your account from the bottom of your "
      p8: "We count total number of flags because that's the most direct measurement of harm:
            occasionally one or two really nasty comments that hit deep negative scores,
            but most often it's a consistent pattern of inappropriate, rude, dismissive, or abusive behavior poisoning many discussions.
            We've tried more complicated measurements, but they correlate almost perfectly to a simple count and are a lot harder to explain than the total number of times another user has flagged your behavior as inappropriate."
      p9: "The warning (and appearance on a mod dashboard) doesn't kick in until an author has received an unusually high number of flags across several comments on several threads because anyone can have a bad day or a bad thread.
            The problem is a pattern across many threads, especially if it's gone on a while."
      p10: "To address some common objections:
            This isn't based on the percentage of the author's comments flagged or the average score because good comments don't excuse bad ones.
            This doesn't ignore comments where you feel provoked or justified because you're still responsible for your words.
            This includes flags on comments with net positive scores because Lobsters isn't a contest to write comments that are slightly funnier or more insightful than they are cruel.
            If you think the people you're responding to don't deserve courtesy and respect: why do you spending time talking to them at all?"
